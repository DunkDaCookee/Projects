Change how course objects store what students take them to a hashmap so multiple students' scores can be 
   tracked in the same course object without having to make additional objects.
Develop main.java so the application can run without the user needing knowledge of what methods the objects have.

Future plans
Create GUI to make app more user friendly.
Search functionality.
